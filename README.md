Goal of the Competition
The goal of this competition is to predict student performance during game-based learning in real-time. You'll develop a model trained on one of the largest open datasets of game logs.

Your work will help advance research into knowledge-tracing methods for game-based learning. You'll be supporting developers of educational games to create more effective learning experiences for students.
